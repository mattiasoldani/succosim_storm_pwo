# succosim_storm_pwo

This is a clone of the [**succosim** repository](https://github.com/mattiasoldani/succosim), customised for the development of the INFN AXIAL/ELIOT/STORM/OREO project. Most notably, it embeds a custom model of crystalline strong-field interactions. It can be downloaded either as a ZIP archive, from the Code drop-down menu [here](https://github.com/mattiasoldani/succosim_storm_pwo), or directly from the terminal (open in your project working directory) via
```shell
git clone https://github.com/mattiasoldani/succosim_storm_pwo.git
```
Further details can be found in the [original project page](https://github.com/mattiasoldani/succosim).
